# Simulator

## Purpose

The simulator is the local debug path inside the unified viewer app. It lets you validate runtime behavior, frame submission, input plumbing, and rendering without a headset.

## App Layout

The reusable SwiftUI simulator implementation lives in
`clients/Apple/common/OXRSysSimulator/` and exposes `OXRSysSimulatorView`. The standalone Apple app in
`clients/Apple/oxrsys-simulator/` is a thin wrapper around that shared view.

The Qt simulator shared code lives in `clients/Qt/oxrsys-simulator-shared` and is reused by:

- `clients/Qt/oxrsys-simulator`: standalone simulator shell
- `clients/Qt/oxrsys-home`: embedded Developer tab simulator

The Apple viewer exposes two viewing modes:

- `Simulator`: mono preview with simulation controls
- `StereoView`: stereo side-by-side presentation for headset-style viewing on iOS

On macOS, the app is primarily used in `Simulator` mode. On iOS, the same target can switch between `Simulator` and `StereoView` from the in-app settings sheet. The macOS Home can also open `OXRSysSimulatorView` from its Developer tab when Developer Mode is enabled.

The Qt simulator is a single `Simulator` mode. It can run as the standalone
`oxrsys-simulator` app or inside the Qt Home Developer tab.

## How Simulator Mode Works

The viewer connects to the runtime as a streaming client, using the same UDP protocol as the iOS and visionOS players.

`Simulator` mode:

- Discovers the runtime via UDP broadcast (port 9943)
- Receives encoded video frames and decodes them locally
- Captures keyboard and mouse input and sends simulated tracking data to the runtime
- Displays a single-eye preview across the full screen

The Qt simulator uses the same UDP discovery, video, control, and tracking ports. On Linux with
FFmpeg development libraries available at build time, the Qt widget decodes the H.265 stream into
its preview panel. If no decoded frame is available yet, it shows a synthetic pose preview using the
same simulated head pose that is sent to the runtime.

The settings sheet also lets you:

- switch between `Simulator` and `StereoView` where supported
- toggle streaming stats
- tune the stereo IPD offset
- request a keyframe
- reset device pose in `StereoView` on iOS

`Simulator` mode is useful for:

- quick local checks
- API debugging
- render loop validation
- input system iteration

It is not a replacement for real headset validation.

## macOS TestFlight Packaging

The macOS app target is App Store-ready for upload with a generated `LSApplicationCategoryType` of
`public.app-category.developer-tools` and a sandbox entitlement file. The sandbox keeps UDP client
and server network entitlements enabled because discovery, video receive, tracking, and control all
use the streaming protocol.

## Apple Simulator Controls

| Input | Action |
| --- | --- |
| Right mouse button | Capture or release relative mouse look |
| Mouse move while captured | Head look |
| Mouse wheel | Move forward or backward |
| `Z Q S D` or `W A S D` | Move head |
| `Left Shift` + `W A S D` | Move left controller |
| `Right Shift` + `W A S D` | Move right controller |
| `Q / E` | Roll head |
| Arrow keys | Alternate head look |
| `F / G` | Left or right grip |
| `Escape` | Menu button |
| `T` | Toggle controller mode or hand tracking mode |

## Qt Simulator Controls

| Input | Action |
| --- | --- |
| Right mouse button in the preview | Capture or release mouse look |
| Mouse move while captured, or left-drag | Head look |
| Mouse wheel | Move forward or backward |
| `Z Q S D` or `W A S D` | Move head |
| Arrow keys | Alternate head look |
| `R / E` | Roll head |
| `F / G` | Left or right grip |
| `Escape` | Release mouse capture |

## Limitations

- Pose quality does not match real headset tracking.
- Simulator timing does not replace real streaming latency measurements.
- The Qt video preview currently requires complete non-FEC UDP frame reassembly; missing video
  packets can drop a frame instead of requesting retransmission.
- Optical characteristics, compositor behavior, and headset-specific runtime behavior still require device validation.
- `StereoView` is a side-by-side viewer mode, not a full optical distortion pipeline.
