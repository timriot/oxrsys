# OXRSys Runtime

[![License: MPL-2.0](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MPL--2.0-blue.svg)](LICENSE)

## Project

OXRSys Runtime is an unofficial OpenXR runtime that started on macOS and is being moved toward a measured cross-platform shape. The repository includes the shared runtime, Apple frontends, Qt frontends, and an Android VR streaming client for Quest/Pico-class headsets.

OXRSys is independent software. It is not affiliated with, endorsed by, sponsored by, or approved by The Khronos Group, Meta, Apple, LunarG, or the owners of the platforms, SDKs, runtimes, and trademarks referenced by this project.

### Android VR Client

The Android VR client can be used over WiFi or USB. The USB path is the best way to experiment with the runtime because it gives the lowest latency. Install `adb` first.

### Home Apps

OXRSys Home exists as a native Apple app and a Qt app. The Apple app owns the macOS direct-distribution workflow. The Qt app is Linux-first and also keeps its launcher code portable for macOS and Windows.

## Disclaimer

**Current Status**: This project is in early development and is not yet production-ready.

### Technical Limitations

- macOS Support: Due to non-standard OpenXR implementation on macOS, specific workarounds are required. OXRSys Home can launch configured apps with `XR_RUNTIME_JSON`; command-line launches remain useful for debugging.
- Meta Quest Integration: The interface is currently minimal; the app displays a blue screen during standby and a green screen during loading.

### Stability & Contributions

Expect frequent crashes and bugs. Contributions are welcome through bug reports, feature requests, and pull requests.

### AI Disclosure

This project uses AI-generated code and documentation. We appreciate professional cooperation regarding this approach.

## Dependencies

- macOS 13 or later for Apple frontends and the Metal runtime path
- Linux with Vulkan, FFmpeg development libraries, pkg-config, and Qt 6 for the Linux runtime and Qt frontends
- C++20
- CMake with FetchContent
- Ninja
- OpenXR SDK headers and loader
- Metal
- Vulkan headers for interop paths
- Android SDK, Android NDK, and Java 17 for the Android client

## Status

- macOS: Metal rendering, core runtime flow, Vulkan interop, and loader-backed runtime tests are in place.
- Linux: Vulkan runtime scaffolding and an FFmpeg encoder path are wired; real Vulkan image readback is still the main remaining Linux video gap.
- Windows: layout and documentation scaffolding only in this pass.
- `XR_EXT_conformance_automation`, `XR_EXT_hand_tracking`, `XR_EXT_hand_interaction`, and `XR_EXT_debug_utils` are implemented.
- The Android VR client feeds real Quest/PICO hand joints into the runtime, gates controller poses with explicit active flags, supports WiFi UDP and reconnecting USB ADB reverse TCP streaming, matches per-frame render poses for smoother headset reprojection, exposes a first-pass `XR_FB_foveation` path when supported by the headset, and can request a build-configured display refresh rate.
- The visionOS viewer uses a minimal floating search window, then enters immersive VR automatically once the stream connects and sends head pose, hand joints, and first-pass tracked accessory controller data back to the runtime when available.
- OXRSys Home is now a direct-distribution launcher and runtime installer for compatible apps such as Godot and Unity, with a main-window runtime activity summary, transport readiness controls, and an optional Developer tab for opening the integrated simulator preview, mouse-driven head tracking, and live runtime streaming stats.
- As of March 17, 2026, the pinned non-interactive OpenXR-CTS baseline is green locally: 63 passed, 36 skipped, 0 failed.

## Contributing

Contributions from humans and LLM-assisted workflows are welcome. Keep changes small, tested, and documented: if behavior, architecture, build steps, or platform support changes, update the relevant files in `docs/` and `AGENTS.md` in the same patch.

Before considering a change ready, run the build and tests for the affected platform. If you touch the Android client, also run the Android build. If you touch runtime API or conformance-sensitive behavior, run the CTS lane when practical.
